WHAT THIS SITE IS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Monochromacy is a satirical corporate parody site for a fictional company.
Tagline: "Moving Fast, Breaking Everything. That's the Monochromacy way."
Self-description: "Fortune 500-Adjacent™"

The premise: a tech company with zero self-awareness, infinite buzzword budget,
and catastrophically bad leadership that genuinely believes it is visionary.
The site is entirely deadpan. The company never winks at the camera.

It started as a series of satirical tweets (2020–2024) and grew into a full
Next.js site with real AI-powered interactive apps.

THE ORIGIN — 12 FOUNDING TWEETS (verbatim)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
These tweets ARE the lore. The site is a direct expansion of this universe.
Read all 12 before writing a single word of copy.

Tweet 1:
  When our employees told us they'd rather continue working remotely than come
  back to the office, we hired a team of mercenaries to bring them back in
  anyways.
  That's the Monochromacy way.

Tweet 2:
  Today we announced our org-wide NPC bounty initiative. If an employee can
  prove that one of their colleagues is an NPC, that employee will receive a
  week of PTO & a unique Monochromacy NFT.
  Insecurity, that's the Monochromacy way.

Tweet 3:
  We have preemptively leaked all our company's data as part of our 2023 risk
  mitigation strategy. TIN's, SSN's, EIN's, our Wi-Fi password, the whole deal.
  Transparency, that's the Monochromacy way.

Tweet 4:
  To whoever stole our Xerox VersaLink C500 laser printer, we know who you are
  and we will find you.
  [No hashtags. The only tweet written with genuine emotion.]

Tweet 5:
  At Monochromacy, being #agile is a critical part of our business's success.
  That's why every morning our employees complete a NATO standardized obstacle
  course before starting the day.
  That's the Monochromacy way.

Tweet 6:
  Here at Monochromacy.co, our employees come first. That's why once a month
  each of our team members is allowed to swear under their breath during a
  client meeting.
  That's the Monochromacy way.

Tweet 7:
  When we remodeled our office, our contractor asked if we had any specific
  requirements. We simply said: Make it like a casino. We don't want them to
  know what time it is or how to get out.
  That's the Monochromacy way.

Tweet 8:
  We fired our data engineer. They proposed we use data and analytics to better
  inform our decision making. But at Monochromacy we know better. Once you give
  the computers that kind of power, that's how Skynet happens. Not on our watch.
  #data #skynet #analytics #innovation

Tweet 9:
  Year to date, 17 of our employees have been thrown under the bus. 9 survived
  with minor injuries, 6 were considered to be in critical condition and 2 are
  no longer with us.
  That's the Monochromacy way.
  #innovation #teamculture #workplaceculture #monochromacy

Tweet 10:
  We just sent seven pallets of raw carrots to one of our autoparts
  manufacturing customers for absolutely no reason at all.
  Unpredictability, that's the Monochromacy way.
  #innovation #service #thinkingdifferently #innovationculture #deliver

Tweet 11:
  At Monochromacy we take our analysis and research to the next level. When we
  take a deep dive, we mean it literally... we recently purchased a submarine
  and everything.
  (We wear sailor outfits, it's fun.)
  That's the Monochromacy way.
  #deepdive #analysis #analyze #innovation

Tweet 12:
  We're ecstatic to announce Shannon Miller will be joining our executive team
  as our Chief Lasagna Officer. Although her background is in finance, she once
  was a server at an Olive Garden in South Dakota, and based solely on that
  factoid alone we were sold!
  Welcome Shannon!

BRAND VOICE RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Deadpan always. The company is completely sincere about everything it says.
2. Catchphrase: "That's the Monochromacy way." — use to close announcements.
3. Bad news is presented as a feature: "Transparency, that's the Monochromacy way."
4. Corporate buzzwords are used unironically: synergy, agility, leverage,
   paradigm shift, deep dive, circle back, thought leadership.
5. Employee welfare is an afterthought dressed up as a perk.
6. The stolen printer is ongoing lore — unresolved, emotional, real.
7. Shannon Miller is the Chief Lasagna Officer. This is not a joke to them.

TECH STACK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Framework:   Next.js 15 / React 19 / TypeScript
Deployment:  Cloudflare Pages
AI:          Anthropic Claude via @anthropic-ai/sdk (model: claude-sonnet-4-6)
Styling:     CSS Modules per component + global CSS variables in globals.css
Fonts:       Playfair Display, DM Mono, Bebas Neue, IBM Plex Mono, IBM Plex Sans

Build for Cloudflare:  npm run pages:build   (NOT npm run build)
Local dev:             npm run dev


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THE APPS (current state)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
/                  Homepage — CEO tweets, stats, hero, ticker
/innovations       Showcase of 6 "products" (3 live, 3 conceptual/vaporware)
/npcdetect         NPC Detect™ — AI HR interrogation, 7 questions, NPC probability score
/officeodyssey     Office Odyssey™ — text adventure in casino-style infinite office
/agileforce        AgileForce™ Morning Protocol — NATO obstacle course reaction game
/portal            Internal app launcher dashboard (UI only, no real function)
/shop              Merch placeholder (Shopify integration TODO)

/api/chat          Server-side proxy for NPC Detect → Anthropic API calls
/api/adventure     Server-side proxy for Office Odyssey → Anthropic API calls


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CODE PATTERNS TO PRESERVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
API security:
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY lives server-side only (Cloudflare env var)
  - Never referenced in client components or passed to the browser
  - All Claude calls go through /api/chat or /api/adventure route handlers

Multi-screen interactive apps:
  - Use "use client" + useState<Screen> to manage views
  - Typical flow: boot → interview/game → verdict/result
  - Examples: npcdetect (boot → interview → verdict),
              officeodyssey (intro → playing → ending)

AI response parsing:
  - NPC Detect expects [VERDICT]{...JSON...}[/VERDICT] blocks in AI output
  - Parsed client-side with regex: text.match(/\[VERDICT\]([\s\S]*?)\[\/VERDICT\]/)
  - cleanText() strips the verdict block before displaying conversational text

Styling:
  - CSS variables: --black, --white, --accent (defined in globals.css)
  - Each route gets its own .module.css file
  - No CSS frameworks — all custom


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WATCH OUT FOR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
- README.md is outdated — it only documents the original NPCDetect launch.
  Do not trust it for route listings or full feature scope.
- Cloudflare Pages uses a custom build: npm run pages:build
  Standard `npm run build` output is not what gets deployed.
- Do not expose ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in any client component or API response.
- Do not break the CSS variable naming convention (--black, --white, --accent).
- The AgileForce app has no Anthropic dependency — it's pure client-side logic.
- The Portal and Shop pages are UI-only placeholders. Don't wire up real logic
  without explicit instruction.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THAT'S THE MONOCHROMACY WAY.
